1. When clicked, all other elements should disappear in a staggered time.
2. Once the animation is about to finish, increase the width and height of the clicked shape's svg
3. Once the svg fully covers the screen, then goto the new page.
4. Finally, when exiting, 
    1. The SVG needs to fade out
    2. Zoom the background div (plain color) out and start back with a new shape config.
